# 🐢 TLaaS – Too Lazy as a Service (FastAPI Practice Project)

This is a personal project I created to learn FastAPI in Python because I believe the best way to learn is by building.
It mostly just refuses requests because it’s too lazy.

It’s a playful API that mostly just refuses requests because it’s too lazy to help. 

### Disclaimer:

- If you're a future employer or future teammate: This project is meant to be fun and does not represent my actual work ethic or personality. (Well… maybe just a little.)
- The API is built purely for the sake of practicing API design, request handling, and having fun while learning.
